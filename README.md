# Dashboard-with-analysis
This repo contains a various datasets along with their analysis, EDA and Interactive dashboard.

The datasets are taken from various sources like Quandl, Kaggle, World Bank data etc.

Each worksheets has the raw data, filtered data, analysis worksheet, EDA Worksheet and dashboard worksheet which are interactive with slicers.

More analysis could have been implemented but I restricted to what I saw fit best.

Note: Slicer was used to make each pivot chart responsive to the connection of the slicer.
